# SLAESolver
This app is an interactive tool for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (SLAE) using numerical methods.

Key Features:

- Implementation of both Gauss elimination and Gauss-Seidel iteration methods
- Support for custom input of coefficient matrices and right-hand side vectors
- Configurable precision and maximum iteration count for iterative methods
- Step-by-step solution breakdown with intermediate results and transformation stages
